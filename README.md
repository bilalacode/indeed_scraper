This is a web scraping project that scrapes job listings from Indeed using Selenium and ChromeDriver. The project is designed to extract job details such as job titles, company names, job descriptions, application links, and other relevant information. It then stores the data in a CSV file for further analysis.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3
- ChromeDriver (Download ChromeDriver from the official website: [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads))

You can install the required Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install selenium undetected-chromedriver csv
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/indeed-job-scraper.git
cd indeed-job-scraper
```

2. Set up the `next_button_url.txt` file with the initial URL you want to scrape job listings from.

3. Download ChromeDriver and place it in the project directory.

4. Run the main script to start scraping job listings:

```bash
python main.py
```

The script will open Chrome with the provided URL and start extracting job details. It will then save the data to `job_details.csv`.
